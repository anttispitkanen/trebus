# TreBus

### The fastest bus app in Tampere

A simple app that locates the user and fetches route data from Tampere public transport
API. HTML5 geolocation and geocode.xyz API to locate the user.

TreBus uses localStorage to store the user's own hotspots (=regular bus destinations),
so it requires no identification or common database.

Node, Express and (Create) React (App).
